# Bare-Bones

This is a generic engine for developing any kind of app on [Nanobox](http://nanobox.io). This _should not_ be the first engine you use. Find engines that are ready to run your app in [the guides](https://guides.nanobox.io). But if you want to be explicit about every step or build something of your own this is a place to start.


## Usage
To use the Bare-Bones engine, specify `barebones` as your `engine` in your boxfile.yml

```yaml
run.config:
  engine: barebones
```

## TODO

This is currently a work in progress. The following items still need handled.

- Figure out what there is to test, and how.
